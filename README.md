# UAV-CrackX

This dataset is a **UAV-based pavement crack semantic segmentation dataset** captured at a flying altitude of **50 m** with **different magnification levels**.  
The detailed data acquisition and processing procedures can be found in our IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems paper:  
> [**Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Based Pavement Image Stitching Without Occlusion, Crack Semantic Segmentation, and Quantification**](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2024.3424525)

## üìò About

The **public dataset** contains **1,500 UAV road images**, including:  
- üü¶ 500 images at **√ó4 magnification**  (UAV-CrackX4)
- üü© 500 images at **√ó8 magnification**  (UAV-CrackX8)  
- üü® 500 images at **√ó16 magnification**  (UAV-CrackX16)

A detailed dataset description is available in our paper published in *Automation in Construction*:  
> [**Bridging Cross-Domain and Cross-Resolution Gaps for UAV-Based Pavement Crack Segmentation**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2025.106141)  
> *Automation in Construction*, vol. 174, p. 106141, 2025.

We also release **1,200 annotated images** (400 for each magnification level).  
The annotations are grayscale masks, where:  
- `0` = pavement  
- `1` = crack

## üèÅ Competition

A benchmark competition using **300 test images** (from different magnification levels) is hosted at:  
üëâ [http://vlp.chd.edu.cn/tasks/4](http://vlp.chd.edu.cn/tasks/4)

Participants can submit segmentation masks to evaluate their models on multiple performance metrics.
